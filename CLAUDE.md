# GTM Intelligence — Claude Code Context

## What this project is

A full-stack AI-powered GTM research tool for AEs and SDRs. You type a company name, it searches 5 AU-specific sources and returns a structured brief in ~30 seconds: company snapshot, ICP fit score, buying committee with pain points, recent triggers, cold email opener, talk track, and more. Built as a portfolio piece by a Senior AE learning to code.

Primary dev environment: **Replit** (runs the live app). This local clone is synced to GitHub and used for Claude Code / Cursor sessions.

**Architecture (DB, API routes, persistence decisions):** see [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md)

## Stack

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, Vite, Wouter (routing), TanStack Query
- **Backend:** Express 5, Anthropic SDK (web_search tool), Drizzle ORM
- **DB:** PostgreSQL (on Replit) — ICPs, signals only
- **AI model:** `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` — intentionally kept on Haiku while validating token usage; switch to Sonnet once stable
- **Codegen:** Orval reads `lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml` → generates types in `lib/api-client-react` and `lib/api-zod`
- **Package manager:** pnpm workspaces

## Key architecture decisions (summary)

Full detail in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

- `openapi.yaml` is the single source of truth. Never edit generated files directly.
- Codegen: `/opt/homebrew/bin/node ./lib/api-spec/node_modules/orval/dist/bin/orval.mjs --config ./lib/api-spec/orval.config.ts`
- **Postgres:** ICPs (drive brief scoring + signal radar), signals. **Not** briefs, Your Company, or history.
- **localStorage:** Your Company (`gtm_your_company_v2`), brief history, recent searches.
- **Your Company** sent in POST body (`yourCompany`) → seller context in Claude prompt.
- **LinkedIn posts + own intel** in POST body → highest-priority research context.
- **Account brief AI routes:** `POST /account-brief` (web search), `/cold-email` and `/talk-track` (regenerate from brief JSON), `POST /market-prospect` (web search).
- **Battlecards:** UI removed earlier; REST API + OpenAPI removed in `66cfe13`. DB table schema file remains — see architecture doc.
- Clearbit autocomplete from browser (no backend proxy).

## AU-specific sources (in the backend prompt)

1. Company website + blog
2. ABN / ASIC registry
3. Seek job postings (highest signal for pain points)
4. LinkedIn C-suite posts
5. AFR / SmartCompany / fintech.com.au

## Shipped (through commit `af903c6`)

- Sidebar layout, polish, collapsible recent searches, Your Company page
- Your Company Phase B+C (localStorage → API → prompt)
- Save as ICP from brief
- ICP scoring prompt tuning (uses AE context + defined ICPs)
- Cold email tone toggle (Formal / Direct / Conversational) + regenerate endpoint
- Talk track generator
- Market prospecting page (`/prospect`)
- Export brief (download .txt, print PDF)
- GitHub README
- Battlecard API cleanup
- Cite tag stripping in AI responses
- Null-safe Save as ICP when brief omits optional sections

## Milestone 1 — Your Company as product spine (commit `1cc399b`)

- **Your Company** is the first sidebar item (Setup section above Research)
- First-run redirect: unconfigured users land on `/your-company`, not Search
- Brief generation gated until Your Company is complete (empty state + CTA)
- Expanded `YourCompany` schema: `companyName`, `oneLineDescription`, `industryServed`, `geographies`, `dealSize`, `buyerTitles`, `painPointsSolved` (+ optional `customerOutcomes`; legacy prompt fields derived on save)
- localStorage bumped to `gtm_your_company_v2` — no migration from v1 (see `c39795a`)
- Hero treatment on Your Company setup page

## Next milestones (not built yet)

- **Milestone 2:** Source-planning Claude call — reads Your Company, returns recommended research sources with reasoning; user reviews and saves source set
- **Milestone 3:** Flexible Brief schema — enterprise buying committee vs SMB single decision-maker based on `dealSize`

## Backlog (next ideas)

- Normalize partial `AccountBrief` responses on backend before returning
- Drop orphan `battlecards` Postgres table (migration)
- Optional GitHub Actions typecheck CI
- ICP scoring / brief quality tuning as you use it in the field
- Consider Sonnet for full brief generation once Haiku token profile is stable
- README screenshot + live Replit URL

## Gotchas

- **pnpm preinstall hook** blocks `pnpm run X` locally. Work around with direct `node` paths (see codegen above).
- **Generated files are committed** — do not `git clean` generated dirs without re-running Orval.
- **Replit is live.** After push to GitHub, `git pull` on Replit. No install if only TS changed.
- **Node 26** locally at `/opt/homebrew/bin/node` if `node` not in PATH.
- **TypeScript:** `node node_modules/.pnpm/typescript@5.9.3/node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc`
- **api-client-react composite project:** run `tsc -p lib/api-client-react` if frontend can't see new OpenAPI types.
- **Haiku may return partial brief JSON** — frontend guards with optional chaining; see architecture doc.
